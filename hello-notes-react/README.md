# Hello Notes React

Primarily as a development target for learning React Hooks.
Also trying to make use of Tailwind for CSS.

TODO (no particular order)

1. Fix element alignment / padding throughout
2. custom tailwind border style?
3. tailwind production css reduction
4. enzyme vs. react-testing-library
5. locale bundle <--
6. Note time in note viewer <--
7. husky / pre-commit prettier
8. Change API id to URI
9. Category editor / categories from API
10. Responsive UI
11. Error handling for actions


BUGS

1. Changing note while editing leaves things in a wonky state
- prevent note change / throw up save dialog?
