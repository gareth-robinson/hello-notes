Primarily as a development target for learning React Hooks.
Also trying to make use of Tailwind for CSS.

TODO (no particular order)

2. Fix element alignment / padding throughout
3. Padding / margins for note titles & body
4. custom tailwind border style?
5. tailwind production css reduction
6. note search
7. note classification / tag
8. enzyme vs. react-testing-library
9. locale bundle
10. separate tooltips for time & title in note viewer
11. 'this note is deleted' message for items in trash
12. extract reducer
13. husky / pre-commit prettier
14. Change API id to URI
15. Make note entries consistent height
