Also trying to make use of Tailwind for CSS.

3. custom tailwind border style?
4. tailwind production css reduction

6. enzyme vs. react-testing-library
7. locale bundle
8. 'this note is deleted' message for items in trash <--
9. extract reducers / extract actions
10. husky / pre-commit prettier
11. Change API id to URI
12. Category editor / categories from API
